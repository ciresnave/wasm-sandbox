## [0.2.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added

- **Comprehensive trait-based architecture** with dyn-compatible core traits and extension traits
- **Extension traits** for async and generic operations (`WasmInstanceExt`, `WasmRuntimeExt`, `RpcChannelExt`)
- **Downcasting support** via `as_any()` method on all trait objects
- **Enhanced test suite** with 15 tests covering integration and trait structure validation
- **Complete trait design documentation** (`TRAIT_DESIGN.md`)
- **Benchmark suite** for performance validation
- **Production-grade clippy compliance** with appropriate allow directives

### Improved

- **Code quality**: Eliminated all compiler warnings (20 â†’ 0)
- **Architecture**: Refactored to support both concrete types and trait objects
- **Documentation**: Enhanced with comprehensive trait usage patterns
- **Testing**: Added trait structure tests ensuring dyn-compatibility
- **API design**: Better separation between core and advanced functionality

### Fixed

- **Async function warnings** in extension traits (intentionally allowed for internal APIs)
- **Unused variable warnings** throughout codebase
- **Dead code warnings** for API-design fields

### Changed

- **Breaking**: Core traits are now dyn-compatible (generic methods moved to extension traits)
- **API**: Advanced async/generic operations now require importing extension traits
- **Architecture**: Runtime abstraction now supports trait object usage patterns

### Technical Details

- **Trait Objects**: All core traits (`WasmRuntime`, `WasmInstance`, `WasmModule`) support `dyn` usage
- **Extension Pattern**: Advanced features available through `*Ext` traits
- **Migration Path**: Existing concrete type usage continues to work seamlessly
- **Performance**: Zero-cost abstractions maintained for direct usage
