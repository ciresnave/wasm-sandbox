# Changelog

## [0.5.3] - Unreleased - README accuracy

### Fixed

- README no longer claims "network and filesystem limits" or `Loopback // Only localhost`. What is enforced today: instruction (fuel) limits and environment-variable allow-lists. Filesystem and network capabilities are not yet applied: the guest gets neither whatever is granted (fails closed). Applies to every earlier release; see #11.
- README security example used APIs that do not exist (`FilesystemCapability::ReadOnly`, `InstanceConfig::max_memory`); replaced with a working one.

## [0.5.2] - Unreleased - Corrected security guide, examples

### Fixed

- `docs/guides/security-config.md` documented an API that never existed (`NetworkCapability::Connect`/`Listen`, list-valued `Capabilities` fields, `SecurityProfile`, `TenantConfig`, builder `.capabilities()`); rewritten against the real API, with a table of which settings the runtime actually applies (only `environment` and fuel today; see #11). Closes #8.

### Added

- `examples/security_config.rs` and `examples/sync_plugin_call.rs` (compiled by CI). The latter shows the supported pattern for #7: a synchronous plugin export called with an awaited host call.

## [0.5.1] - Unreleased - Patent sweep record

### Added

- `docs/PATENT-SWEEP.md`: due-diligence patent sweep for the 0.5.x line (13 hits read, none needing review). Not legal advice.

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased - Dependency refresh

### Breaking

- **wasmtime / wasmtime-wasi 34 -> 50.** WASI preview1 now comes from `wasmtime_wasi::p1`; `WasmtimeStoreData::wasi` is a `WasiP1Ctx` (was `wasi_common::WasiCtx`).
- **wasmer 6 -> 7.5, wasmer-wasix 0.600 -> 0.705; `wasmer-runtime` is no longer available on Windows.** wasmer 7 has no native compiler backend on Windows (Cranelift and Singlepass both refuse to build); enabling the feature there is now a `compile_error!`. Linux and macOS are unaffected.
- Minimum supported Rust version is now 1.97 (wasmtime 50).
- Engine configuration: `max_wasm_stack` is now 1 MiB. The previous 4 GB value is rejected by wasmtime 50 (`max_wasm_stack` may not exceed `async_stack_size`) and `WasmSandbox::new()` failed with it.

### Changed

- Updated all dependencies to their latest versions (`rand` 0.10, `toml` 1.x, `cap-std` 4, `tokio`, `thiserror`, `uuid`, `chrono`, `rmp-serde`; dev: `criterion` 0.8, `rstest` 0.28, `mockall` 0.15). Supersedes dependabot #6.
- Removed unused dependencies: `wasi-common`, `wit-bindgen`, `wasmtime-component-macro`, `wasmtime-component-util`, `winapi`.
- Added hosted CI (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, test `--locked`, doc, cargo-deny) and `deny.toml`; code formatted with `cargo fmt`.

## [0.4.1] - 2025-07-16 - Security & Quality Update

- **Dependency Updates**: Updated wasmtime to 34.0.1 which includes security patches
- **Security Documentation**: Updated security advisory documentation

### 🧩 Wasmer Implementation

- **Impact**: These issues are low-risk as they are build-time dependencies

### 🎯 Recommendations

- **Runtime Choice**: Both Wasmtime and Wasmer are now production-ready options
- **Feature Flags**: Use `wasmer-runtime` feature for Wasmer support

// With timeout for safety
let result: String = wasm_sandbox::run_with_timeout(
    "processor.py", "process", &"data", Duration::from_secs(30)
).await?;

// Builder pattern for control
let sandbox = WasmSandbox::builder()
    .source("my_program.rs")
    .timeout_duration(Duration::from_secs(60))
    .memory_limit(64 * 1024 * 1024)
    .enable_file_access(false)
    .build().await?;

### Breaking Changes

- Bumped version to 0.3.0 to reflect major API additions
- New APIs are **additive only** - all existing APIs remain unchanged
- Enhanced type safety may require `+ 'static` bounds in some generic contexts

### Migration from v0.2.0

**No breaking changes!** All existing code continues to work. New APIs are purely additive:

```rust
// v0.2.0 (still works)
let mut sandbox = WasmSandbox::new()?;
let module_id = sandbox.load_module(&wasm_bytes)?;
let instance_id = sandbox.create_instance(module_id, None)?;
let result: i32 = sandbox.call_function(instance_id, "add", (5, 3)).await?;

// v0.3.0 (new simplified option)
let result: i32 = wasm_sandbox::run("my_module.wasm", "add", &(5, 3)).await?;
```
