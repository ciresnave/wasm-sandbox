# Community Guidelines

üìñ **[‚Üê Back to Documentation](../README.md)** | üè† **[‚Üê Main README](../../README.md)**

Welcome to the wasm-sandbox community! This document outlines our community guidelines, code of conduct, governance structure, and how to get involved.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Enforcement

Violations of the code of conduct may be reported to the project team. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Governance Model

wasm-sandbox follows a meritocratic governance model where technical decisions are made through consensus among contributors, with maintainers having the final say in case of disagreement.

### Project Roles

#### Users

Users are members of the community who use wasm-sandbox. They contribute to the project by:

- Providing feedback on features, bugs, and documentation
- Participating in community forums and discussions
- Helping other users

#### Contributors

Contributors are community members who contribute to the project in various ways:

- Code contributions (features, bug fixes)
- Documentation improvements
- Testing and quality assurance
- Design and UX
- Community support

#### Maintainers

Maintainers are contributors who have shown dedication to the project and have been granted additional privileges:

- Merge pull requests
- Triage issues
- Release management
- Setting project direction
- Technical decision making

### Decision Making Process

1. **Discussion**: Ideas are discussed openly in GitHub issues, discussions, or community forums
2. **Proposal**: Formal proposals for significant changes are documented as GitHub issues or pull requests
3. **Consensus-seeking**: The community works toward consensus through open discussion
4. **Decision**: Maintainers make final decisions, considering all input from the community

For significant changes, we use a Request for Comments (RFC) process, where proposals are documented and discussed before implementation.

### Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have consistently demonstrated:

- Technical expertise
- Good judgment
- Commitment to the project
- Alignment with project goals
- Positive community interactions

...may be invited to become maintainers. Existing maintainers nominate and vote on new maintainers.

## Communication Channels

Our community uses the following channels for communication:

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports, feature requests, and general discussion
- **GitHub Discussions**: Long-form discussions about project direction and ideas
- **Discord Server**: Real-time chat and community building
- **Mailing List**: Announcements and important updates
- **Community Calls**: Regular video calls for synchronous discussion

### Guidelines for Communication

- Be respectful and kind to other community members
- Stay on topic and keep discussions productive
- Use appropriate channels for different types of communication
- Be mindful of international participants (avoid slang, explain acronyms)
- Remember that text lacks tone; assume good intentions from others

6. Respond to feedback and make requested changes
7. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

- **bug**: Something isn't working as expected
- **enhancement**: New feature or improvement
- **documentation**: Documentation improvements
- **good first issue**: Good for newcomers
